Essential Tracking Categories to Add:
Water Changes Section:

Date of change
Volume changed (gallons/percentage)
Reason (nitrite spike >5ppm, maintenance, etc.)
Impact on cycle (can reset bacterial progress)

Tank Additions/Interventions:

Date added
Product/item (bacteria doses, pH adjusters, decorations, plants)
Quantity/dosage
Reason for addition

Environmental Factors:

Room temperature changes
Power outages/equipment failures
Filter maintenance/cleaning
Lighting changes (affects algae/bacterial competition)

Water Source Tracking:

Batch of pre-filtered water used
Any changes to source water treatment
Seasonal municipal water chemistry changes (Ottawa varies)

Bacterial Health Indicators:

Water clarity (clear, cloudy, bacterial bloom)
Surface film presence
Odor notes (earthy = healthy, sulfur = anaerobic issues)
Bio-film formation on surfaces

Critical Cycle Events:

First ammonia drop detected
First nitrite appearance
Peak nitrite reading
First nitrate detection
Cycle completion confirmation test
